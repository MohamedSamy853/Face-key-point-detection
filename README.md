# Face Key Points Detection Project
This README file provides an overview of the Face Key Points Detection project. The project involves using PyTorch to build a model for detecting facial key points. The VGG16 architecture is utilized as the backbone for the model. A data pipeline is created to load images and corresponding key points (68 points), adjusting the points' positions relative to the image size. Finally, a pre-trained model is used in conjunction with OpenCV to perform facial key points detection.
## Project Overview
The Face Key Points Detection project aims to detect and locate key points on human faces, such as the position of the eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial landmarks. By utilizing computer vision techniques and deep learning, this project enables the automated extraction of facial features from images.
## Architecture and Workflow
1. **Model Development**: The project leverages the PyTorch framework to build a model for facial key points detection. The VGG16 architecture is employed as the backbone, providing a robust feature extractor for the task.
2. **Data Pipeline**: A data pipeline is established to load images along with their corresponding key points. The key points are adjusted to account for the varying sizes of the input images, ensuring their relative positions are accurate.
3. **Pre-trained Model Integration**: A pre-trained model is utilized in combination with OpenCV to perform facial key points detection. The pre-trained model provides a foundation for accurately locating the facial landmarks on the input images.
## Conclusion
The Face Key Points Detection project offers a solution for automated facial key points detection using PyTorch, VGG16 architecture, and OpenCV. By accurately locating and extracting key facial landmarks, this project can find applications in various domains, including facial recognition, emotion analysis, and virtual reality.
